EliteFit.AI Coding Test

Time Spent on Coding Test:
I spent approximately 6 hours on the coding test.

Most Useful Feature in Latest Version of Chosen Language:
One of the most useful features added to JavaScript in recent versions is the Array.prototype.find() method. This method returns the first element in the array that satisfies the provided testing function. Here's an example of how I've used it in the task management application:
javascript:
function editTask(taskId, title, description, dueDate, priority) {
    const task = tasks.find(task => task.id === taskId);
    if (task) {
        task.title = title;
        task.description = description;
        task.dueDate = dueDate;
        task.priority = priority;
        updateTaskLists();
    }
}
In the editTask() function, tasks.find() is used to find the task with the given taskId. If the task is found, its properties are updated accordingly.

Tracking Down Performance Issues in Production:
To track down a performance issue in production, I would follow these steps:

1.	Identify the Problem: Use monitoring tools to identify areas of concern such as slow response times, high CPU or memory usage, or long database query times.
2.	Analyze Logs and Metrics: Analyze logs and metrics to pinpoint the source of the performance issue. Look for patterns or anomalies that could indicate bottlenecks or inefficiencies.
3.	Benchmarking and Profiling: Use benchmarking and profiling tools to measure the performance of specific components or functions in the application. This helps identify where the most time is being spent.
4.	Code Review and Optimization: Review the code related to the identified performance bottleneck. Look for areas where optimizations can be made, such as inefficient algorithms, excessive database queries, or unnecessary resource usage.
5.	Testing in Staging Environment: Implement potential optimizations or fixes in a staging environment and perform thorough testing to ensure they address the performance issue without introducing regressions or new problems.
6.	Continuous Monitoring: Continuously monitor the application in production to ensure that the performance improvements have been effective and to catch any new issues that may arise.
Yes, I have experience tracking down performance issues in production environments and have used various tools and techniques to identify and address them.

Additional Features or Improvements for Task Management Application:
If I had more time, here are some additional features or improvements I would consider adding to the task management application:

•	User authentication and authorization system to allow multiple users to manage their tasks securely.
•	Ability to set reminders or notifications for upcoming tasks.
•	Support for recurring tasks (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly).
•	Enhanced sorting and filtering options for tasks based on different criteria such as due date, priority, or completion status.
•	Integration with calendar applications or task management tools for seamless synchronization of tasks.
•	Implementation of data persistence using a database to store tasks persistently across sessions.
•	User interface enhancements to improve usability and aesthetics, such as drag-and-drop functionality for task organization or dynamic updates without page reloads.
